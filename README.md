### What is CropsPlus?
CropsPlus is a plugin that enchances minecraft's vanilla crops mechanics and makes them a lot better.

### Features
- The plugin is fully customizable in the configuration file.
- Right-clicking on the crops drops the loot and replants them.
- The growth detector indicates at what level the crop is.
- I implement every good idea to the plugin.
- And many more cool features coming soon!
